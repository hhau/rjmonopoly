Description: Functions that enable appropriate order selection for monotonic
    polynomials. Users provide their univariate polynomial data, and limits on 
    the minimum and maximum allowable polynomial degrees. In return they
    get samples from the posterior of both polynomial degree and regression 
    parameters.
